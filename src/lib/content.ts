	'This tutorial introduces the "StoryWrangler" project, a platform for analyzing massive large-scale corpora such as Twitter, Wikipedia, Bluesky, Reddit, and Google Books. Each dataset offers a distinct window into collective discourse: Twitter captures real-time conversation, Wikipedia documents collaborative knowledge construction, Reddit preserves threaded community discussions, and Google Books provides historical context. Despite their differences, these platforms exhibit similar heavy-tailed statistical properties, allowing consistent analytical frameworks while respecting platform-specific dynamics. We cast them into a set of interconnected time series that track the changing usage rates of words, phrases, and topics.',
	'We show how the StoryWrangler platform implements principled measurements such as rank-turbulence divergence to detect and quantify changes in text over time. These instruments help identify when language use shifts dramatically, track the rise and fall of narratives, and compare patterns across timescales and platforms. Drawing on the work of research engineers at the Vermont Complex Systems Institute, we offer a window into a suite of scientific tools for measuring collective attention, working toward a unified StoryWrangler for everything.',
	'The platform offers three levels of technical accessibility: front-end portals for visual exploration without coding, Python packages for custom analyses, and API access for large-scale studies. We discuss the technical challenges that come with ensuring accessibility for researchers across all technical backgrounds.'

RTD is a visualization instrument designed for the comparison of any two ranked lists of heavy-tailed distributions which exhibit type turbulence. Following this introduction to RTD, we introduce a number of tools building on divergence metrics to capture collective attention (Allotaxonometry and Ousiometry).'
